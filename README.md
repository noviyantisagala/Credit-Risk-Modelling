Credit risk model  using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees


Credit risk modelling is an important activity for financial institutions to help reduce 
the risk that a debtor will default on a personal/commercial loan. One of the most
widely used models in the credit scoring context is logistic regression, which I will
use in this project to explore and examine a sample credit data set.
